# Old Car Value Predictor
This project predicts the value of old cars using machine learning regression models. It utilizes features such as mileage, age, model, and brand to predict the price of used cars.

# Features:
- Utilizes machine learning regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
- Evaluates model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- Visualizes predicted prices against actual prices using seaborn regression plots.


## Project Flow:
### 1. Data Preparation:
  - Collect dataset containing information about old cars including features like mileage, age, model, and brand.
  - Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering as needed.
### 2. Model Training:
  - Train machine learning regression models using the preprocessed dataset.
  - Utilize Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression models for prediction.
### 3. Model Evaluation:
  - Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
  - Compare the performance of different regression models to select the most accurate one.
### 4. Prediction:
  - Predict the value of old cars using the trained regression models.
  - Visualize the predicted prices against actual prices using seaborn regression plots for better understanding.
